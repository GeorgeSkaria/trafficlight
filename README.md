Simulation of traffic light using Java Swing

# Traffic Light Simulator
This Java program simulates a simple traffic light using Swing and AWT. It allows you to control the traffic light's colors (red, yellow, and green) by selecting the corresponding radio buttons. The selected color is displayed, and the code draws a graphical representation of the traffic light in the window.

## Features
- **Radio Buttons**: You can select "Red," "Yellow," or "Green" using the radio buttons to change the traffic light's state.
- **Visual Representation**: The program provides a graphical representation of the traffic light with the selected color highlighted.
- **Text Feedback**: The program displays a text feedback message indicating the current state of the traffic light (e.g., "Stop!" for red).

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run the Java program using an IDE or command line.
3. A window will open with the traffic light simulator. You can use the radio buttons to change the light's color and observe the graphical and text representation.
4. Close the window when you're done.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

## Running the Program

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Java source code.
3. Compile the program using the following command:

   ```
   javac trafficlight.java
   ```
4. Run the compiled program with the following command:

   ```
   java trafficlight
   ```
5. The program's window will appear, allowing you to interact with the traffic light simulation.
